								<h3>Critical Incidents Stress Debriefing</h3>
								<p>MBS offers CISD as a part of their EAP services. Critical incidents are traumatic events that cause powerful emotional reactions in people who are exposed to those events. The most stressful of these are the line of duty deaths, co-worker suicide, multiple event incidents, disaster or terrorism, delayed intervention and multi-casualty incidents and more, sadly.</p>
								<p>CISD (Critical Incident Stress Debriefing) is designed to help people deal with workplace trauma incidents by returning back to “normal” as soon as possible. Normal is different for everyone, and it is not easy to quantify. Critical incidents raise stress levels dramatically in a short period of time and after treatment, a new normal is established, however, it is always higher than the old level. The purpose of the debriefing process is to establish or set the new normal stress levels as low as possible.</p>
								<p>EAP counseling for individuals and families to assist in difficult times.  We are able to provide 3-12 brief sessions that include the assessment during the first appointment. Assessments and brief solution focused therapy to address issues from pre-marital, child/adolescent behavioral concerns, grief, family issues and substance abuse issues. Employee Assistance Programs (EAP) are employee benefits programs offered by many employers.  EAPs are intended to help employees deal with personal problems that might adversely impact their job performance, health, and well-being.  EAPs generally include short-term counseling and referral services for employees and their household members.  Supervisors may also refer employees (supervisor referral) based on the unacceptable performance of conduct issues. </p>
								<p>MBS Behavioral Health & Wellness offers EAP services and is a contracted provider with many EAP sources. An Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is a voluntary, work-based program that offers free and confidential assessments, short-term counseling, referrals, and follow-up services to employees who have personal and/or work-related problems.  EAP Counselors at MBS address a broad and complex body of issues affecting mental and emotional well-being, such as alcohol and other substance abuse, stress, grief, family problems, and psychological disorders.  EAP counselors at MBS also work in a consultative role with managers and supervisors to address employee and organizational challenges and needs.  MBS EAPs are active in helping organizations prevent and cope with workplace violence, trauma, and other emergency response situations.</p>
